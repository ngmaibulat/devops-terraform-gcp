1. When configuring a backend for the first time (moving from no defined backend to explicitly configuring one), Terraform will give you the option to migrate your state to the new backend. This lets you adopt backends without losing any existing state.
2. To be extra careful, we always recommend manually backing up your state as well. You can do this by simply copying your terraform.tfstate file to another location.
